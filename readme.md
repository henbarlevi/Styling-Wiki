## run project with **npm run dev**

* #### this is the new script of npm run dev (using npm-run-all library)[run 'compile' and 'start' in the same window]
  
   ```json
        "dev": "npm-run-all --parallel compile start-dev",
   
   ```
* #### this is the old script of npm run dev [run compile and app in 2 different windows]
   ```json
        "dev": "start cmd /k npm run compile && start cmd /k npm start-dev"

   ```
*
   ```ts
   "start cmd" //open new command prompt
   "/k"//execute command inside that new cmd
   ```
